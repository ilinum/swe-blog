### __What did you do this past week?__
Tried to decide on the project, attended class on Monday and Wednesday

### __What's in your way?__
Deciding on the topic of the project. Our group was deciding on the topic for a long time, so we can't start 
(and we really should). First it seemed like we decided on the topic but then one other team took it :(

### __What will you do next week?__
Start on the project!

## Experience in the class
On Monday, we went over specification for Project 1. The Project is building an IMDB but for some other topic. 
The projects sounds like fun (and it sounds like fun to actually build something with Python and flask!).
The hard part is deciding on the topic, at least so far.

On Wednesday and Monday we were going further down the rabbithole of Python. It is fun learning about all the 
different features (I had no idea python had so many). Still this is less features than Scala has. 
Of all the languages I have ever worked with, Scala has the most. Downing should teach a course on that :)
You could also build a website with the [Play framework](https://www.playframework.com/) or 
[Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/) (Scala to Javascript Compiler). 
Or could use [Akka](http://akka.io/), a library to build resilient concurrent application that uses actor-system based
concurrency. 

## Pick of the week
[Scala tutorial](https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/) from Twitter is a great way to learn Scala. 
You can install the Scala repl and code away! 
If you're just starting, [here](https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/basics.html) is the basics tutorial.
