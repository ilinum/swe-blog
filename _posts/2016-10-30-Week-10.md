## Experience in the class
So this week I did some SQL, and I think it's pretty nice. It's useful in one of my other classes this semester (Android)
and also I had questions in SQL for 3 of my interviews!
SQL seems to be pretty cool, largely because it is so small (correct me if I'm wrong, I might totally be). 

This time we went into regex, with which I was familiar already. They are nice for one time things 
(like a quick find-and-replace), but I try to avoid them in production code because they are unreadable. 
And readability is one of the most important things in production code. The code has to be *maintainable*,
if it is not, it's useless. 

## Pick of the week
I have two picks of the week for you this time:

* [CodeCrap](http://codecrap.com/content/best/) - if you want to look at some bad code, this is a place to go. 
Here is one of my favorite snippets: 

```
// Happy debugging, suckers
# define true (rand() > 10)
```
* [RegexCrossword](https://regexcrossword.com/) is a good way to practice regexes, especially since we just covered them.
