### __What did you do this past week?__
We were working on IDB2 and did not have the easiest time. 
Even though everyone was contributing, for some reason we weren't able to finish it. So that was pretty upsetting.
In class on Monday and Wednesday we went over XML and Json, which (I personally think) is pretty useful.
I did not know certain things about XML (but I had to deal with parsing it previously, so I knew it was a pain). 
However, json is pretty straitforward (which is super nice), so I did not have trouble learning that. 
I had to miss the Friday class for an on-site interview, so I have one less quiz, it's harder to get an A. 

### __What's in your way?__
This week is going to be really busy. So, time. 
Also, I am a little discouraged after this project didn't turn out to go very well. 

### __What will you do next week?__
Hopefully start on project 3, so that we can be done sooner! But we probably need to finish up part 2 first.

## Pick of the week
If you have some time to waste, [here](http://codepen.io/shamittomar/pen/dMQgXr) is a bizzare way to enter your phone number. 
You are shown a number, and you have to say if your phone number is bigger or smaller than that. 
This goes on until you get your phone number. 
I got mine in 31 clicks!
But basically, this is an example of really bad design and it is fascinating what people can compe up with.
