## Overview of the class

The class was definitely an experience. I can definitely say that I learned quite a bit.
Just the sheer amount of technologies you have to use.

Compared to OOP, the class is way harder (or at least was for me).
But at the same time I learned so much more. 

Coming into the class I was not familiar with most of the tools that we used, 
which I think made the class more challenging. 
The Projects is where I definitely learned the most. 

I did have some issues with the quizzes. You can read me complaining about them more 
[here](http://ilinskiy.me/swe-blog/Week-12/) and [here](http://ilinskiy.me/swe-blog/Week-13/).
In short, they were really hard and we only got to drop 1 out of 31. 

## Pick of the week

My pick of the week this time is [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js).
Reveal js is a framework for creating and showing slides. 
You can check it out by following the link and pressing "space". 
You define the contents of the slides in html or markdown and it creates a presentation for you. 
You can show the presentation anywhere (even on mobile!). 

I made a presentation with it in Summer 2015 
([source](https://github.com/ilinum/ilinum.github.io/tree/master/internship2015), [presentation](http://ilinskiy.me/internship2015/))

My second pick of the week is [StackOverflow Developer Survey 2016](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016)
The results were published recently, so if you love data and graphs, you should absolutely check it out!


Professor Downing, thank you for a great semester!
