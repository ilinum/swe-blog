### __What did you do this past week?__
I set up docker and started on Collatz. 

### __What's in your way?__
Getting Sphere to accept my solution seems to be really hard and require some really intense optimizations. 

### __What will you do next week?__
Finish up Collatz.

## Experience in the class
### Rank
I have never been a fan of comparing people to one another in terms of grades. 
I think it makes people more focused on competing with each other than on learning. 
Last semester when I was taking OOP everyone was ranked based on their grades. This semester it's only the top half of 
the class. I think this is a good idea that avoids discouraging people. However, I do not think
it leads to positive results for most people in the top of the class taking the focus away from learning to competing. 

### Class
So far the class is going over exact same things as OOP in terms of material, except we do it in Python. We went over 
Project 1, which is identical to Project 1 of OOP and over exceptions. The classes are actually useful but not as much
when you listen to them the second time. Downing said that we're going to go into other topics not covered in OOP later on. 
Hopefully, next week will be more new. 

## Tip of the week
Use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)! Pycharm is a great IDE that is free for students. 
It's perfect to use for this class (and project 1 especially):
* It has autopep8 support built in
* It works out of the box, setup is easy
* Rename variables refactoring (you need to do it a lot for project 1 in order to make pylint happy)
* [Debugger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJtWxm12Eo0)
* [Code navigation (Ctrl+click takes you to definition) and completion](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/coding_assistance.html)
* Excellent Git support
