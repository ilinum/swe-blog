## Experience in the class
In the lectures on Monday and Friday we went over similar stuff. It seems like we are getting more into functional programming. 
What I would be interested to look at is the performance of the functional way of writing things (with reduce and map and all
that) as opposed to regular imperative programming. 

What was really exciting last week is a guest lecture from [Jet Propulsion Lab](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/). The lecturer
was talking about software development (agile specifically) and the project that he had been working on, a Virtual Reality
technology that lets people walk on Mars. From what he has shown us it seemed like it worked pretty well, which is exciting. 
Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXT-ynvI3Lg) about it.


## Pick of the week

I stumbled upon an interesting [article](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3061519/evidence/the-ux-secret-that-will-ruin-apps-for-you)
that talks how some software products make their user artificially wait for a result of a query. 
> ...he was working on a loan approval app. The back end was atypically fast. It could get someone a true lender-backed mortgage instantly. But when the app makers put that experience in the hands of consumers, people responded in disbelief. "When they saw it, they were like, ‘I’m pre-approved but not really approved,'" he says. So the designers added a progress bar that said it was checking credit, and suddenly, the same system seemed trustworthy.
